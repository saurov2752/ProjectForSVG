## The initial dimensions of the SVG figure taken from the JSON file.
## Click the blue part and move your mouse. Perimeter of the rectangle will be changed and you'll see value of perimeter under the rectangle.
## After resize the rectangle, dimensions will be updated and saved into the JSON file.
